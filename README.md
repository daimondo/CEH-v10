# CEH-v10
These are my notes taken from following a variety of different study material on Certified Ethical Hacker v.10 on YouTube, the CEH v9 study guide, Twitter etc.

These were written at the very start of my journey into the world of the Red Team, and similarly to the CEH certification, they serve as an introduction to many of the tools with not much substance.
